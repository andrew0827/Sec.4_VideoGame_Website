  <h1>A FIFA 19 Review</h1>

    "With a plethora of new modes and some significant gameplay tweaks that make ball control more convincing, FIFA 19 is a distinct improvement upon last year's effort. 
    Not all of these additions hit the mark, however, such as the Gears of War-style shooting mechanic and a handful of the new Kick-Off modes. 
    When coupled with an underbaked The Journey single-player campaign, those slow down its momentum a bit. 
    That said, FIFA 19â€™s simply more fun than recent entries with a level of variety that should only increase its longevity."
