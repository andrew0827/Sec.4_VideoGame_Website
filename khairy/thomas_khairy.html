        <h3>Trading</h3>
        <p>Rocket League has one of the largest platforms for interactive playerbase thanks to its highly popularized trading system. Players can unlock different items in a variety of manners and trade them to obtain their dream car. There are 8 different item rarities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="item rarity">Common</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Uncommon</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Rare</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Very Rare</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Import</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Exotic</li>
          <li class="item rarity">BLack Market</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Limited</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Players can unlock items either through crates, tradeups, or trades. Players can win crates through games, but can only open them using a key, which is tradeable on all platforms. Players can unlock anything from rare to black market items in a crate, with a 55% chance of getting a rare item, a 28% chance of getting a very rare item, a 12% chance of getting an import item ,a 4% chance of getting an exotic item, and finally a 1% chance of getting a black market item. <br> Through tradeups, players can use 5 items of the same rarity from the same collection (type of crate) to obtain an item of the next rarity from the same collection. <b> FInally, players can trade all items from uncommon to limited with eachother.</p>
