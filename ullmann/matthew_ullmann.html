        <h4> Rating 9/10 </h4>
        <p>This game deserves a 9 out of 10 because it contains a great
          story along with amazing gameplay. What really blows this game
          out of thr water is its stunning visuals. Things that make the
          game even better is its amusing multiplayer. What dosen't make this
          a perfect 10/10 is its bloated third act which is when the content 
          becomes a little repetitive from its previous 3 games.</p>
