<h2>What is Call of duty Black Ops 4</h2>
    <img src= “./bo4gp.jpg”/>
<p> Call of Duty Black Ops 4 is part of the Call of Duty series. The game was made primarily by Treyarch Games and Raven 
   and published by Activision. The game is a first-person shooter and has three game modes. The three game modes are Multiplayer
      the new Blackout Mode and Zombies. The game is a sequel to the 2015 game Call of Duty Black Ops 3. This review will be focusing 
   more on the multiplayer mode. This is the first Call of Duty title that does not have campaign but instead has solo missions that
      focus on the backstories of the game's multiplayer characters.</p>
<h3> What's Good about the game</h3>
<p>Something that I really like about the game is the fact that most of the specialist carried over to the game from Black Ops 4. Some
   of the specialist form the previous title of Call of Duty did not transfer but their abilities did. For example, one of the new
   specialist called Recon got his abilities from Outrider from Black Ops 3. Something else that is good about the game is the ability
   to create paintjobs on your weapon which allows the player to design his weapon. The maps in Black Ops 4 are very good. The maps most
   of the time are very spaced and compact at the same time. This means that a player could chose a SMG or an Assault Rifle as a weapon.
   Finally, soemthing that I really like is the fact that they added Nuketown to the game. This is a very popular map in the Black Ops 
   series and had been in every game that has been designed by Treyarch. This time, the map is set in the 1950s on an undisclosed nuclear
   testing facility in the American Southwest.</p>

<h4>What's Bad about the game</h4>
<p> In my opinion, there are many bad things about this game. One of the most annoying things is Torques barricade that emits a microwave
      field that slows down enemies and damages them. This is annoying because lets say you are playing Domination, a game mode in which you
      have to capture objectives, all a player has to do is put down this barricade and no one will capture the objective unless they want
      to die. Another problem and anoying thing about the game is the SAUG 9mm, a submachine gun, duel willed which means you have two guns
      instead of one. This does mean that you can not aim.The gun is already powerful but when you add two of them, it is almost impossible to stop. 
      The only thing that can stop it is if you create distance between you and the player using the gun. Another problem with the game is Ajaxs 
      ability which is a ballistic shield with a built-in machine pistol.This mean that Ajax can kill you with his machine pistol and he will not
      take any damage.Finally, the Titan. The Titan is a light machine gun that is overpowered if you equip FMJ. This gun will have the ability to
      shoot down helicopters or even care packages before it even gets to the map.</p>

      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p>In my opinion, if you really want the game, then go ahead and buy it. I would only buy the game if it is on sale. I would personally wait
         for fixes with the game as there are many problems.</p>
