      <p>Super Smash Bros. 4 (or SSB4) is the fourth game in the Super Smash Bros. franchise. It was released on the 3DS and Wii U consoles. This review
        will be reviewing the game in general, and not so much of the differences between the 3DS and Wii U versions. This game brought many 
        new game modes to the series, such as Smash Run, and new characters (old favourites from previous games return as well) and new stages to fight on.
        Characters, stages and items come from a variety of game franchises, which has always been the Super Smash Bros Series' winning factor. 
        You can fight with your favourite characters from games you played in the past, and battle with characters from other games you might
        of played/encountered throughout your gaming experiences. This and the fact that you can battle fellow gamers around the world,
        makes the Super Smash Bros franchise a very special and loved series. Super Smash Bros. 4 definitely deserves to be called a Smash Bros game, 
      however this does not mean it has no faults or mistakes.*This review will be reviewing the features of Smash Bros. 4 3DS Version, and only be mentioning the Wii U version periodically.*</p>

    <div class= "Game Modes">
      <h2>Super Smash Bros. 4 (3DS Version)'s Game Modes</h2>
      <p id= "Smash Mode">This is a basic classic mode like in every other Smash Bros game where two or more opponents fight until one of them lose.
        When one clicks on the Smash button on the home menu, they can expect to see a solo button –– where the player plays against <strong>one</strong> CPU (Central Processing Unit, the computer),
        and a group button –– where up to four players connect locally and battle each other, however they must expect that lag will occur if there are four players. 
        After choosing which mode you want, the player will see the list of characters unlocked (and purchased). After choosing which character
        they want to fight as, the battle will begin! Players can change the settings in both modes, such as playing with/without items, 
        choosing if they want a time limit or lives (they can choose how many they want for all players), and much more.</p>
      <p id= "Online Mode">This is where the player goes if they want to battle online. This mode sounds pretty great at first, since playing online
        always is fun and exciting. However, on the 3DS version, playing online gets REALLY laggy, especially with four players fighting eachother. On the Wii U version,
        this is definitely less of an issue. Players can choose whether they want to battle friends or random players online. A more competitve option named "For Glory" is available
        for hardcore players, since their results are documented. In my personal opinion I find the "causual" option boring since it is only online team battles,
        which lags all the time.</p>
      <p id= "Challenge Mode">The "Challenge" button on the home menu is a list of all the achievements the player unlocked. Everytime an achievement is unlocked, an award
        is given. This is a pretty neat feature, since it gives the player another goal to achieve and something to do in the game, if they are somehow getting bored with it.
      <p id= "Smash Run">Just like Smash Mode, Smash Run has a solo/group option. In Smash Run, the player chooses a character and is spawned in a unique stage and competes against four players.
        This stage is never-ending and has many areas to explore. The objective of this mode is to defeat enemies so you gain stats. The more enemies defeated, the more stats gained. 
        When the timer runs out, the four fighters fight against each other on one random "regular" battlefield-like stage. However wins, gets a prize. This prize can be used to customize a
        fighter in customization mode. Smash Run is pretty fun and unique, especially since it was introduced in SSB4, however it gets quite repetitive after awhile, since the map never changes and the enemies
        remain the same (but located in different spots).</p>
      <p id= "Games and More">The Games and More mode is a variety of mini-games the player can choose from. There's the classic hand mode, where you keep on fighting Fighter CPUs until you reach the final boss,
        Master Hand! Master Hand's gets a buddy, Crazy Hand, when the intensity/difficulty level of this game increases (the player chooses the difficulty level). When Master Hand is defeated, you see the end credits
        and then proceed to get a Trophy of the fighter the player used to defeat him, which can be viewed in the Vault section of this game mode. Another feature in this game mode is All-Star, where the player chooses
        their fighter to fight against the smash bros fighters, in order of their creation date. Other mini-games/features of this mode include Training Mode, where the players enhance their skills, Multi-Man Smash, where the
        player fights an onslaught of Mii's, and many more.</p>

    <div class= "Conclusion">
      <h2>The Final Verdict</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, Super Smash Bros. 4 is an overall good game, and because of the variety of fighters to choose from and the many different types of game modes, SSB4 is definitely a worthy candidate of the Smash Brothers series. 
        The real disappointing part of this game is the online mode, especially the on the 3DS version, since it is pratically useless because of the lag. The praticality of SSB4's 3DS version <em>is</em> pretty nice,
        however, it is not the type of game to be playing with cramped controls and a pretty mediocre sized screen! It is safe to say that for $50, you are getting
        a lot for your money. Hardcore players should play the The Wii U version of the game, for a bigger and better quality screen, much better graphics and improved mechanics.
        However a GameCube controller is needed for the best results, because the Wii U's controllers honestly just suck.</p>
